	ABOUT GO EXTENSION

	The Go extension for VS Code provides syntax highlighting that differentiates keywords, variables, types,
	and other Go code elements, improving readability and helping to spot syntax errors using language grammar files for color coding.

	It offers real-time error reporting and diagnostics through gopls, the Go language server implementing the Language Server Protocol,
	performing syntax and type checking and generating inline error messages with red squiggly lines for errors.

	The extension includes linting to detect potential problems that may not prevent code execution but violate Go conventions,
	showing warnings as yellow squiggly lines and integrating with tools like golint, staticcheck, and gocheck; errors prevent
	execution while warnings allow the code to run.

	Code formatting automatically adjusts the code according to Go conventions whenever you save (Ctrl+S), correcting indentation,
	spacing, and structure, using gofmt or goimports to ensure a consistent style.

	Code navigation features like Go to Definition, Find References, and code suggestions allow developers to track where variables or
	functions are defined and referenced, analyzing relationships across the codebase via gopls.

	IntelliSense provides code completions, function signatures, and auto-suggestions as you type, using context and available libraries
	to suggest the most relevant code.

	The extension integrates with Delve for debugging, allowing setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variables directly
	inside VS Code.

	The Go extension acts as a pre-compilation analyzer to catch many errors before code execution, aligning feedback with Go compiler
	rules to reduce runtime errors and enhance code quality, adherence to conventions, and overall productivity.
